# WebMD-Scraper

Created from scratch an efficient web scraper to mine WebMD for data on all the drugs listed on the website as well as the customer reviews for those drugs.  Using this data, along with data from public databases on drug side effects, to classify the drugs using deep recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory cells.  This classification will allow for the identification of novel drug repurposing candidates.
